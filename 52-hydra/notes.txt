Cohesion, Coupling and Configuration

Why configuration settings hard ?
- Add to lot of places ex. dataset path, experiment log path, url paths
- Single place to define them
- Store configuration place at one place then need many methods to pass them around - weak cohesion
- If define global variables - lot of coupling if something is missing, then failures. 

Solution
- each defined locally where used in file -> settings all over the place and hard to find
- Environmnet dotenv -> script access variables - change them without changing code. Not directly easy which ones you can change and no structure. Unrrelated
variables together and what effect they will have
- JSON / YAML file with specifications -> add structure - sub objects for different layers - use package hydra.
