- develop library for particular set of tasks  -> Software Architecture
- Code Organization
    - Lowest level -> syntax elements / solutions for specific problem (for vs while, store data in list vs array, sorting algo)
    - Design Level -> Design principle and pattern - structure and organize everything (stratergy or observer pattern or code reduce coupling or single responsibility)
    - Software architecture -> Top layer defines philosophy or approach of how code works or solves problem 
    - ex. Django -> model view template architecture
    - Model View Controller architecture 
        - model deals with data
        - view presentation of model in particular format
        - controller logic that binds the two
    - In example, controller depend on abstract class for model and view
- model view controller is software architecture and within that have design principles included
- pipeline is a software architecture to model processing sequences
