# 7 Python code smells
The example is about employees at a company. In `before.py`, you find the original code (containing 7 code smells + a bonus smell). The `after.py` file contains the same code, but a lot less smelly.

- Code Smells -> Not bug but something wrong in program, issues with code design
- Do Refactoring
