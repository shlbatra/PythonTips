- Pandas
- Dataframe
    - Table with rows and cols
- Series
    - Single col of info
- Use numpy array and dtypes to build pandas dataframe -> fast as built in c#
- not have timezone aware of datetime -> so added in it pandas
- period dtype -> timeseries (freq)
- sparse matrix representation to store efficiently
- type for interval
- categorical types
- store data as string or object type
- use as type (convert dataframe from 1 type to another)
    - df.astype("float32")
    - df.astype({"a":"bool", "c":"float64"})
    - pd.to_numeric(df)
- string not very efficient for storage - due to duplication, use categorical for optimization (representations smaller than enteries)
