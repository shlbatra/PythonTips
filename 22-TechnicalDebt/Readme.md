- Software full code coverage, latest tech and 100$ future proof - not realistic with deadlines
- Delibrate Tech Debt
    - take some shortcuts for meeting deadlines -> leave few things for later on 
- Accidental Tech Debt
    - Outdated design -> future proof design and deliver to market soon, 
    - full blown refactor might be required in case market feedback leads to outdated design
    - prog lang evolve with time so change code
    - library outdated
- Bit Rot
    - lots of incremental changes -> other people not understand design 
    - more layering happen 
- Manage tech debt 
    - Design before code 
        - make changes easy at this stage
    - Code Review
        - to avoid bit rot
        - set of practices that team adheres to - team responsible

        - Write as actual task as part of sprint plan

        - do small quick refactors
    - Prioritize debt items and note depedencies between them
    - Use Metrics to manage tech debt
        - code coverage for unit tests
        - count tech debt cards and track progress
        - number of bugs / issues
