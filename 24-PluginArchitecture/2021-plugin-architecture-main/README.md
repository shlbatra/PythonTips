# Plugin Architecture

- add functionality to application without changing single line of original code including imports
- extend code after it has been shipped
- Ex. game add update that adds new characters or new levels
- Architecture that allows you to do that without touching code -> Plugin Architecture
- register /unregister plugins at any time -> factory (model registering/unregistering of diff character types)
- extend GUI for application, extend data processing apps
