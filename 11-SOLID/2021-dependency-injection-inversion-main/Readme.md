- Depedency 
    - object type & class coupled 
    - ex. class inherits from another class, object of class passed as method to another class method, class has attribute of another class type
    - inheritance strongest depedency -> coupling so better use composition
- Dependency injection is a design pattern that splits creation of objects from their usage. 
    - seperate responsibility for creating and using objects
- Dependency inversion is a design principle that promotes using abstract classes and interfaces to better separate code. Inversion requires Injection.
