- better seperation between diff modules in your code
- 2 roles 
    - subject ->  does things and changes things and notifies observer of any changes happened
    - observer -> 
- Ex. Event management system ;  handle User Interface
- use event system to seperate coupling 
- ex. many event libraries in python. here. event.py
