- Cohesion  
    - Degree to which elements of certain class/function belong together. 
    - clear responsibility , 1 task ex. Cosine fn in math library, code easier to reuse
- Coupling 
    - measure of how dependent 2 parts of your code are on each other
    - high coupling bad as need to make changes multiple places
    - ex. pass data directly to method or move function within object directly
- Look for Information expert - where is the information that app uses centered
