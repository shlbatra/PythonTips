# Encapsulation and information hiding

- Encapsulation
    - Grp things such that each group represents essential features
    ex. Customer class - all data represent customer
    - Defines boundary around things, restricting access in some way, 
    ex. Instance variables or methods private or protected
    - closely related to cohesion = increase cohesion

- Information Hiding
    - Hide certain aspects of code to outside, provide interface for other class / methods use. Ex. Payment processor - stripe , hide stripe methods and stripepaymentprocessingmodule - dont need implementation details, 
    - Ex. order class here
    - related to coupling = reduce coupling
    - reduce depedency by introducing abstraction layers between diff parts of code
