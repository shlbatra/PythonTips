- API Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or device before allowing them access to an APIâ€™s protected resources.
- API Authorization controls access to specific resources or actions within the API. Determines what actions a client or user is allowed to perform via API
- Types of Authentication
1. Basic Authentication
Involves sending a username and password with each request. This is generally done using the HTTP authorization header, and the credentials are encoded using Base64.
Ex.
import requests
url = "https://example.com"
# Use the following format for the username and password: "username:password"
credentials = "user:pass"
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Basic {credentials}"
}
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
print(response.status_code)

2. Token Authentication
the use of a unique token that is generated for each user. This token is sent with each request, and is used to authenticate the user.The token is usually obtained by the client by sending a request to the server with a valid username and password.It is recommended to use HTTPS for token authentication, and token should be encrypted with JWT or OAuth for the production environment.
Ex.
import requests
url = "https://example.com"
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token}"
}
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
print(response.status_code)

3. OAuth Authentication
OAuth is an open standard for authorization that provides a way for users to grant access to their data without sharing their passwords. OAuth is used to authenticate users and authorize access to a system or service.
Ex.
import requests
from requests_oauthlib import OAuth2Session
client_id = "your_client_id"
client_secret = "your_client_secret"
# The OAuth2Session object handles the OAuth 2.0 flow
oauth = OAuth2Session(client_id, client_secret=client_secret)
# Get the authorization URL
authorization_url, state = oauth.authorization_url("https://example.com/oauth/authorize")
print(f"Visit this URL to authorize the application: {authorization_url}")
# Have the user visit the authorization URL and provide the authorization code
authorization_response = input("Enter the full callback URL: ")
# Get the token
token = oauth.fetch_token("https://example.com/oauth/token", authorization_response=authorization_response)
# Use the token to make a request
response = oauth.get("https://example.com/api/resource")
print(response.json())

4. API Key Authentication
API keys are unique strings of characters that are used to authenticate users and allow them to access the API. The key is generated by the server and provided to the client.
Ex.
import requests
url = "https://example.com/api/resource"
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"api-key {api_key}"
}
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
print(response.status_code)
