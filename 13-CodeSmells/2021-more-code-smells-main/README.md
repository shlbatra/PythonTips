# More code smells

- Code Smells -> Not bug but something wrong in program, issues with code design
- Do Refactoring 
- __str__ -> produce human readable string
- __repr__ -> produce string that represents the object , used to recreate the object
- class methods has access to class instance so it can change class variables / attributes
- static methods - belongs to class because make sense
- use pylint, pylance and black (auto formatter)
